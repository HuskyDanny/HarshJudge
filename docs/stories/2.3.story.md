# Story 2.3: Create Analyze Skill

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Claude Code user,
**I want** an analyze skill that guides project analysis,
**so that** Claude produces consistent, actionable test suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `skills/harshjudge/tasks/analyze-project.md` created as executable task workflow
2. Task triggers defined in `skill.yaml` for: "analyze project", "suggest tests", "what should I test"
3. Task defines sequential analysis protocol with progress reporting:
   - Phase 1: Tech Stack Detection (package.json, config files)
   - Phase 2: Route/Page Discovery (Next.js pages, React Router, etc.)
   - Phase 3: API Endpoint Scanning (routes, handlers, OpenAPI)
   - Phase 4: Database Schema Analysis (if present)
   - Phase 5: Auth Configuration Detection
4. `skills/harshjudge/templates/analysis-output-tmpl.md` created for consistent output format
5. Output includes: tech stack summary, entry points table, prioritized scenario suggestions
6. Task requires user confirmation before proceeding to scenario creation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement analyze-project.md** (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement analysis-output-tmpl.md** (AC: 4, 5)
- [ ] **Task 3: Verify triggers in skill.yaml** (AC: 2)
